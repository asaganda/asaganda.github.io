  <p>My name is Andrew Saganda and I have a high level of interest in technology. I studied environmental science during the undergraduate years followed by a role as an energy analyst as my first position after graduation. A new opportunity unveiled itself where i would head into a new direction undertaking a web development course.</p>
  <!-- <br> -->
  <p>Thinking about how quickly I gained new programming skills and completing a few projects makes me realize what i accomplished in a short time frame, which further propels my interest in technology. I have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.</p>
  <!-- <br> -->
  <p>I am very excited about this next chapter of my professional life and look forward to the endeavors in my future. Because of the support from my family and friends, I have been able to get to where i am now.</p>
  <!-- <br> -->
  <p>Currently, i specialize with Ruby on Rails platform but i am very open to learning more languages and frameworks.</p>
